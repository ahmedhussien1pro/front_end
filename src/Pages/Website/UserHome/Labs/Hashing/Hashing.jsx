                      <span className='content__subtitle me-2'>Hashing</span> is
                      a one-way function that takes a string of any length and
                      returns a fixed-length string. The output of the function
                      is called a hash. Hashing is used to verify the integrity
                      of data. It is also used to store passwords in a database.
                      The hash of a password is stored in the database instead
                      of the password itself. This way, if the database is
                      compromised, the attacker will have a hard time getting
                      the passwords.

                      a one-way mathematical function that turns data into a
                      string of nondescript text that cannot be reversed or
                      decoded. In the context of cybersecurity,
                      <span className='content__subtitle me-2'>hashing</span> is
                      a way to keep sensitive information and data — including
                      passwords, messages, and documents — secure. Once this
                      content is converted via a hashing algorithm, the
                      resulting value (or hash code) is unreadable to humans and
                      extremely difficult to decrypt, even with the help of
                      advanced technology. Hashing has become an important
                      cybersecurity tool for organizations, especially given the
                      rise in remote work and use of personal devices. Both of

                      necessary part of modern business, attackers have come to
                      recognize the inherent vulnerability of stored passwords
                      and user credentials, which means that companies must take
                      additional steps to keep that information secure.

                      Though digital signatures are often used to secure email

                      authenticate and verify any kind of electronic transaction
                      or document. Two main use cases are:

                        During hashing, the hash function will produce a

                        produce a checksum, which is a hash value that reflects
                        the sum of the dataset. This checksum accompanies the

                        user can create a new checksum and compare it to the
                        original. If the two values match, then the data is
                        considered secure.

                        Hashing is a critical part of identity and access
                        management (IAM) tools. By using a hashing tool,
                        organizations can ensure the identity of their users and
                        maintain proper access controls. This helps prevent
                        password-based attacks, such as password spraying or
                        credential theft.

                        A collision is when two or more inputs result in the

                        challenge and must implement a solution to prevent such
                        collisions. For example, a company might implement a

                        Hashing can be a bit of a balancing act. Algorithms are
                        designed to optimize both speed and memory use; they
                        must also be able to support the level of data input
                        needed by the company. This creates significant
                        complexity in terms of algorithm design and evolution.
                        With respect to cybersecurity, a slow algorithm or one
                        facing significant backlogs can translate into higher
                        risk.

                        By definition, hashing is a one-way conversion of data
                        into an indecipherable string of text. Generally, it is
                        impossible to reconvert the hash value back to data.
                        However, some sophisticated adversaries can either
                        discover or guess the hash function, which would allow
                        them to reverse engineer the hash values or tamper with
                        the dataset by creating fake inputs.

                      <span className='content__subtitle me-2'>Hashing</span> is
                      always intended to be a one-way conversion of data. The
                      hash value is a unique string of text that can only be
                      decoded if the adversary is able to steal or guess the
                      hash function and then reverse engineer the data input.

                      on the other hand, is a two-way process. Though encryption
                      also uses cryptographic algorithms to convert plain text
                      into an encoded format, it has a corresponding decoding
                      key that allows users to decrypt the data.

                      <span className='content__subtitle me-2'>Hashing</span>
                      provides you with the ability to authenticate data,
                      messages, files, or other assets. Users can confirm that
                      data sent from one user to another has not been
                      intercepted and altered by comparing the original hash
                      value with the one produced by the recipient. With
                      encrypted data, on the other hand, there is no way to
                      validate the data or tell if it has been changed, which is
                      why hashing is preferred for authentication purposes.

                      Both hashing and encryption scramble data to protect it
                      from hackers. But the way the data is scrambled, and what
                      happens with it after encoding, is different.
